# Quest "Java 07: Inheritance"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

### Goals

This exercises aims at making us understand how the concepts of abstract classes and inheritance work. An example of abstract class in given: <code>Bird</code>, and
two classes extends this abstract class: <code>Duck</code> and </Eagle>, where the abstract method <code>sing</code> from <code>Bird</code> is overrided.

In the same way, the purpose of the exercice is to implement a <code>Vehicle</code> abstact class with a <code>doStuff</code> abstract method, then create two vehicles
extending this abstract class with an override of the <code>doStuff</code> method.

### Execution example

Some instructions are written through a <code>main</code> method in <code>Hangar</code> class to check if the exercise is correct.
